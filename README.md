## Development

### Code Organization

The project follows clean architecture principles:

- **UI Layer** (`ui/`): Handles all user interface logic, event handling, and user interactions
- **Service Layer** (`services/`): Contains business logic for file processing operations
- **Utils Layer** (`utils/`): Provides helper functions and validators

### Key Design Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns**: UI code is separated from business logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a focused, well-defined purpose
- **Qt Signals/Slots**: Event-driven architecture using Qt's signal/slot mechanism

### Adding New Features

To add a new tool:

1. Create a new page in `ui/pages/`
2. Create corresponding service in `services/`
3. Add navigation button in `main_window.py`
4. Register the page in the stacked widget

## System Requirements

- **Windows 10/11 (64-bit)** - Required for the installer version
- No internet connection required
- Works completely offline
- Lightweight and fast

> **Note:** The Windows installer requires 64-bit Windows due to bundled Tesseract OCR and Poppler dependencies. Running from source may work on other platforms.
